### What is Emily?
Emily combines the powers of [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to build stable and consistent machine learning and datascience python environments. Emily is useful for large cross-team project development as well as for simply running a single jupyter notebook or python script.

### Example commands
- ``$ emily open <dir>`` to open a directory as an Emily project 
- ``$ emily open <file>`` to open a jupyter notebook as an Emily project  
- ``$ emily build`` to build a new Emily project 
- ``$ emily install-requirements`` to make Emily install Emily's requirements (Docker and Visual Studio Code)
